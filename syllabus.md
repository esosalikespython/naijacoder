## Syllabus

### Day One: Introductions and Motivations

Python is one of the most beginner-friendly programming languages, thanks to its readable syntax and wide range of applications. It’s used for everything from web development to AI. Learning Python opens the door to coding in a fun and practical way.

### Day Two: Types in Python

Python has different types of data, like integers (int), decimals (float), words (str), and true/false values (bool). Unlike some languages, Python doesn’t require declaring a type before using a variable. Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are also important data types.

### Day Three: For Loops and Recursion

For loops let us repeat actions easily, like printing numbers from 1 to 10. Recursion is a function calling itself to solve a problem, like computing factorials. Loops are simpler, but recursion can be more elegant for certain problems.

### Day Four: More Methods of Iteration in Python

Besides for loops, Python has while loops and list comprehensions. While loops repeat until a condition is false. List comprehensions make it easy to create lists in one line. For example, [x**2 for x in range(10)] creates a list of squares from 0 to 9.

### Day Five: Objects, Libraries, and Data Science

Python is object-oriented, meaning data and functions can be grouped together in classes. Libraries like NumPy and pandas make Python great for data science, allowing for powerful data manipulation and analysis.

### Day Six: Growth of Functions

Some functions run faster than others. Big-O notation helps us measure efficiency. A function that takes O(n) time grows linearly, while O(n²) grows much faster (bad for large inputs). Knowing this helps us write better code.

### Day Seven: Searching Algorithms – Linear, Binary

Linear search checks each item one by one, making it slow for big lists (O(n)). Binary search is much faster (O(log n)) but needs a sorted list. It works by cutting the list in half repeatedly.

### Day Eight: Sorting Algorithms – Bubble, Selection, Insertion

Bubble sort repeatedly swaps elements, making it slow (O(n²)). Selection sort picks the smallest element and moves it to the front (O(n²)). Insertion sort builds a sorted list step by step (O(n²)). These are simple but not the fastest.

### Day Nine: Sorting Algorithms – Part 2

Faster sorting methods like Merge Sort (O(n log n)) and Quick Sort (O(n log n) on average) are used in real-world applications. Merge Sort splits lists into halves, sorts them, then merges them. Quick Sort picks a pivot and sorts around it.

### Day Ten: Review, Recap, Exam

A final review of everything we’ve learned, practicing coding problems, and understanding when to use different techniques. The exam is a chance to test our knowledge and improve.
